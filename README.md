## Securing the Hadoop Data Lake workshop

These workshops is part of a 'Securing the Data Lake' webinar.

The webinar recording and slides are available at http://hortonworks.com/partners/learn

#### Goals 
To demonstrate: 
- Authentication: Configure kerberos with LDAP on HDP sandbox 
- Authorization & Audit: To allow users to specify access policies and enable audit around Hadoop from a central location via a UI, integrated with LDAP
- Enable Perimeter Security: Enable Knox to work with kerberos enabled cluster to enable perimeter security using single end point

Why integrate security with LDAP? 
 - To show how Hadoop plugins into the enterprises existing Identity Management system
